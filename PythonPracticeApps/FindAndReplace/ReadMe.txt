        Building a framework for solving problems:

        1. Define the problem:
              - Create a program that takes a file's text as input
                , prompts user to ask which word they want to find
                , prompts user to ask which word they want to replace it with
                , return the original string with the replaced word

        2. Define the problem's constraints
        3. Choose an approach / strategy (higher-level)
        4. Choose an algorithm
        5. Implementation
        6. Testing / Analysis
        7. Revisit Steps 1-6 as necessary until done
