What I'm building: 
	- an app that allows users to search for recipes via an API, which displays the recipes one at a time. 
	- the user can click on a button which saves the recipe to favorites.
	- the user can search their favorites in the same way they'd search the main recipes, except it displays only their favorites
	- users can add or remove favorite recipes on the individual recipes portion.



	install packages: bootstrap (css), react-router-dom
